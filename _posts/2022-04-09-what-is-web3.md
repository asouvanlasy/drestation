Today's internet is not the same as it was yesterday, and it will not be the same tomorrow. Web3 is the idea of how the internet will look in the near future.

## History of the Web

Web1.0 and Web2.0 refer to eras of the web, similar to how we have generations characterized by age (ex. Millennials, Generation Z).

### Web1.0 (1991 - 2004)

Web1.0 was the first generation of the web where users shared information through static HTML pages filled with text and images. These websites were very simple compared to today, with little to no user interaction.

### Web2.0 (2004 - present)

Web2.0 is the current web that most of us have experienced. This social and interactive web follows the growth of social media, apps and online businesses. Users not only consume content but can also be creators themselves and share content with millions. The ownership of these platforms and their data is dominated by tech monopolies (often referred to as "Big Tech").

Web2.0's biggest problems are on the topic of security and privacy. People aren't happy with the frequent data breaches and privacy violations that happen under Big Tech. Our web is also prone to censorship by authorities, which is a real concern in certain countries.

## What is Web3?

Web3.0 (commonly shortened to Web3) is an in-progress enhancement of Web2.0 using the concepts of **decentralization** and **blockchain** technology. The goal is a more secure, scalable, and private internet that empowers the user. Web3 is still in its infancy, but there are ideas on what it'll become.

### Decentralization

Decentralization means transferring control from a centralized authority (ex. governments, corporations) to a dispersed network of many different members.

In a centralized model, you must place your trust in one authority and hope that they don't do any harm. In a decentralized model, members don't have to trust each other and are deterred from overstepping their authority.

On its own, decentralization sounds pretty complicated, but it's a key concept of how blockchains operate.

### Blockchain

A blockchain can be thought of as a database of transactional records, like a massive spreadsheet. The name comes from how it's made of blocks, with each block holding information about the previous block, forming a chain. Its database uses a decentralized network and cryptography for security.

A blockchain network is spread across many computers around the internet instead of a central server owned by a company. Imagine if that data center were to be compromised by hackers or damaged by a natural disaster. Having the network controlled in a single place and by a single company has too great of a risk.

When data is saved to a blockchain, it is automatically updated and downloaded to every computer on the network so every member has the same copy. This data cannot be modified or hacked unless more than 50% of the network is also compromised. Therefore, as the network grows in members, the more difficult it is to disrupt.

Blockchains are most famously used to process transactions for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These transactions are delivered peer-to-peer, meaning it skips the middle-man such as a banking corporation and is instead sent straight to the person's account. Blockchains also run 24/7, unlike banks which have operating hours.

### So What?

Those were a lot of big words thrown around, so how does it come together to make the internet better?

- The infrastructure holding up the web will be more scalable and resilient

- Web3 is more resistant to censorship, as no singular authority can shut down an entire blockchain.

- Users will have better control of their data since a third party is removed from the equation. Transactions cannot be halted halfway and instead take place directly between two users.

- Decentralized apps (shortened to dapps) are apps that run off code deployed to a blockchain. These types of apps are required to be open-source and operate autonomously (without humans) so that no management of user data is required.

All these ideas and technologies may sound cool, but as of now, Web3 doesn't have much to offer that can reach mainstream appeal like that of Web2.0. Most of these features are invisible to users because they have to do with the backend and infrastructure of websites and apps.

It's unlikely that Big Tech will go away completely. The future will probably incorporate a mix of centralized and decentralized models.

As a new developer, however, it's exciting to look into the future to see where we might be headed.
