title: "First Site Report"
---

Recently, Google Domains (the domain provider for this site) sent me the first report. These reports give you all sorts of analytics including how many times your site appeared in search results to how fast your site loads.

## Reach

For the first time ever, DreStation has appeared in search results. The report states that a desktop user from United States saw this site, but they sadly didn't actually visit it.

## Performance

Using Google's [PageSpeed Insights tool](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), you can test any URL to diagnose site performance on desktop and mobile. I will be placing the emphasis on mobile performance as it's a better metric of how good a website is.

I'm glad to report that DreStation passes with 94% on mobile. This shouldn't be much of a surprise as this site is completely static with only text and images, but I enjoy seeing better scores than that of google.com (59% on mobile).

Unfortunately, the only way I know of right now to speed up loading times would involve removing functionality by removing the JavaScript libraries for displaying syntax highlighting and math.
