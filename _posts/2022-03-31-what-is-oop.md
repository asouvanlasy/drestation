class Person {
    string name = 'Robby'

        say('I can talk!')
    }
}
```

The main purpose of OOP is to bundle up the data and the functions that operate on them, so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

This is useful because your code can 

# Pros of OOP

Object-oriented programming popular among developers for being suitable for large and complex programs that are continuously updated. The alternative
