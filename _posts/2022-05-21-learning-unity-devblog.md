title: "Learning Unity 2D - Devblog"
---

The first year of university is over, so I'm met with an abundance of time and no direction. After struggling to bring myself to start a coding project or to learn a language, then playing the excellent 2D game *Katana ZERO*, I decided to learn Unity 2D game development.

I had used Unity for a short time modifying 3D avatars for *VRChat*, adjusting properties like scale, editing textures, adding sounds, and failing to get eye-tracking working. All of that didn't require any C# coding, but now I can use my knowledge from my C# class this year.

## Getting Started

I knew going into this that if I mindlessly followed a 4 hour long tutorial on YouTube, I wouldn't learn anything. My plan became to go step-by-step through the process, adding one feature at a time.

Thankfully, I found an great tutorial series by [Pandemonium](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOEwFbvGm5o8hayFB6skAfa8Z-mw4dPV) on YouTube which fit my plan. Each video is a topic in of itself and is very digestable. This style of learning is proving to be effective since I can follow an episode and complete a feature each day. I can feel accomplished and motivated because I know I made progress.

## Roadmap

### May 16-21, 2022

### Thoughts on C# Scripting

Coding C# for Unity is surprisingly intuitive. You have the option of using VS2019 or VSC (my preference) which comes handy with IntelliSense/auto-completion. Unity's components are literally OOP "objects".

I'm by no means already a Unity syntax expert, but what I've seen so far is very approachable for a programmer with a year's worth of experience.
