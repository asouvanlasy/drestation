The internet of today wasn't the same as it was yesterday, nor will it be the same tomorrow. Web3 is the idea of how the internet will look in the near future.

## History of the Web

Web1.0 and Web2.0 refer to eras of the web, similar to how we have generations characterized by age (ex. Millennials, Generation Z).

### Web1.0 (1991 - 2004)

Web1.0 was the first generation of the web where users shared information through static HTML pages filled with text and images. These websites were very simple compared to today, with little to no user interaction.

### Web2.0 (2004 - present)

Web2.0 is the current web that most of us have experienced. This social and interactive web follows the growth of social media, apps and online businesses. Users not only consume content, but can also be creators themselves and share content with millions. The ownership of these platforms and their data is dominated by tech monopolies (often referred to as "Big Tech").

Web2.0's biggest problems are on the topic of security and privacy. People aren't happy with the frequent data breaches and privacy violations that Big Tech faces.

## What is Web3?

Web3.0 (commonly shortened to Web3) is a in-progress enhancement of Web2.0 using the concepts of **decentralization** and **blockchain** technology. The goal is a more secure, scalable, and private internet that empowers the user.

### Decentralization

Decentralization means to transfer control from a centralized authority (ex. governments, corporations) to a dispersed network of many different members.

In a centralized model, you must place your trust in one authority and hope that they don't do any harm. In a decentralized model, members don't have to trust each other and are deterred from overstepping their authority.

On it's own, decentralization sounds pretty complicated, but it's a key concept of blockchains.

### Blockchain

A blockchain can be thought of as a database of transactional records, like a massive spreadsheet. The name comes from how it's made of blocks, with each block holding information about the previous block, forming a chain. It uses a decentralized network and cryptography for security.

A blockchain's network is spread across many different computers around the internet instead of a central server owned by a company. Imagine if that datacenter were to be compromised by hackers or damaged by natural disaster. Having the network controlled in a single place and by a single company has too great of a risk.

When data is saved to a blockchain, it is automatically updated and downloaded to every computer on the network. This data cannot be hacked unless more than 50% of the network is also compromised.

Blockchains are most famously used to process transactions for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### So what?

Those were a lot of big words thrown around, so how does it come together to make the internet better?

- Users will better control their own data

- Resistant to censorship

- Trustless, remove the middleman such as banks

That is not to say that Big Tech is going away. Perhaps they'll adapt their current model with the changing tides, or they will lose to competition. Since Web3 is still in it's infancy, it's difficult and wrong to make any predictions now.
