title: "Greek Alphabet Mini Tier List"
---

I've encountered some Greek alphabet letters in my math classes so far in my first year of university. With my exams coming up soon, I got the bright idea to rank the Greek alphabet instead of studying for the math class that I’ll use them for.

Behold, the factual, undisputed, scientific, and peer-reviewed tier list of the Greek alphabet by an English speaker.

## Σ Tier

### Sigma Σ

Fittingly, at the top, is, of course, sigma (Σ). This letter has seen a rise in popularity with the sigma male meme. Sigma is an outcast amongst the other letters, acting as a lone wolf. Despite this, sigma effortlessly achieves popularity and success, even being superior to alpha.

Sigma's traits can be seen in the equation for X<sup>2</sup> in the field of statistics:

$$ X^2 = \Sigma \frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected} $$

As you can see, sigma appears as the first character without even trying. Sigma brings with it its expectation of success as well as the success that you will observe from it. This is unequivocal evidence that sigma is the best letter in the Greek alphabet.

## A Tier

### Lowercase Alpha α

Next up is lowercase alpha (α). Although uppercase alpha (A) is larger and thus traditionally superior, lowercase alpha (α) is more interesting and enjoyable to write because it resembles a fish.

### Uppercase Delta (Δ)

Uppercase delta is an all-around well-designed letter. It's simple to write, and the Latin "D" and Cyrillic "Д" are derived from delta. As far as I'm aware, the "D" sound stays consistent across multiple languages, such as English and French (unlike the horribleness that is "C" or "K").

Such a pleasantly shaped letter can be brought outside language; for example, the delta wing in aerodynamics is named after delta's shape.

## Β Tier

Every letter except omega (Ω) belongs here. I don't have ~~positive or negative opinions~~ scientific facts on these letters.

## Ω Tier

Omega (Ω ω) reminds me of the omega-3 vitamins my Mom tells me to take, therefore it's evidently bottom-tier.
