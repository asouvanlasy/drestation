Software engineers, also known as software developers, are people who solve problems using computers. These problems could range from the math in a calculator to storing your anime profile picture in a database.

Software engineers write code in many languages such as C, Python, or JavaScript in order instruct the computer to do something. They employ creative solutions such as searching up their problem on Google and smashing their keyboards in frustration.

Although software engineers can be very knowledgeable in technologies or languages, the most important skill they attain is problem-solving. Memorizing syntax (code words) is not as important as recognizing programming patterns (i.e. similarities across all languages).
